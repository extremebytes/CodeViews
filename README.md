# CodeViews
Simple Swift based iOS application with views built entirely in code.

Although storyboards and nib files can be a very nice way to visually create and manage your project's views, it can sometimes be difficult to fully see or even change the interconnected layout constraints among your views.  It can also be cumbersome to manage or code review changes to storyboards and nib files when working within a team of developers.

This simple Xcode project, written in Swift, demonstrates how to programmatically create and display views using autolayout techniques without having to utilize storyboard or nib files.  Team members can more easily see any layout changes that occurred without having to look through and compare complicated XML structures used by storyboard and nib files.  This alternative approach no longer gives you nice visual representations of your project's views, but can make working in teams a much easier experience in the long term.
